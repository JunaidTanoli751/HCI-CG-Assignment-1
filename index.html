                <h3>What is Human-Computer Interaction?</h3>
                <p>
                    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with 
                    computers and digital systems. It encompasses design, evaluation, and 
                    implementation of interactive computing systems for human use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the smartphone in your pocket to the ATM machine at your local bank, 
                    from the Daraz app you use for shopping to the Careem interface you rely 
                    on for rides—every digital interaction is shaped by HCI principles.

                <h3>Meet Don Norman</h3>

                <p>
                    Donald Arthur Norman (born 1935) revolutionized how we think about design. 
                    His groundbreaking work transformed product design from engineer-centered 
                    to human-centered, emphasizing that good design makes technology invisible 
                    and intuitive.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, 
                        in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design 
                        is invisible."

                <h3>Why Study HCI?</h3>
                <p>In today's digital Pakistan, understanding HCI is crucial because:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Digital Economy Growth:</strong> With services like JazzCash, 
                        Easypaisa, and Bykea becoming essential, good UX design directly impacts 
                        millions of users daily.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accessibility Matters:</strong> Pakistan has diverse users—from 
                        tech-savvy youth to first-time smartphone users. Inclusive design ensures 
                        everyone can access digital services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Business Success:</strong> Companies like Foodpanda and Daraz 
                        succeed partly because of their intuitive interfaces. Poor UX means lost 
                        customers and revenue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Safety Critical:</strong> Medical apps, banking systems, and 
                        emergency services require flawless interaction design where errors 
                        can have serious consequences.
                    </li>

                <dl>
                    <dt>🎯 Affordances</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Visual cues that suggest how an object should be used. A button that 
                        looks "clickable" has good affordance.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>🏷️ Signifiers</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Indicators that communicate where actions should take place. Icons, 
                        labels, and highlights are signifiers.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>🗺️ Mapping</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The relationship between controls and their effects. Good mapping 
                        makes interfaces intuitive and predictable.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>💬 Feedback</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Information about the result of an action. Every user action should 
                        receive clear, immediate feedback.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>🧠 Mental Models</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Users' understanding of how a system works. Design should match users' 
                        existing mental models from the real world.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>🚧 Constraints</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Limitations that guide behavior and prevent errors. Physical, semantic, 
                        cultural, and logical constraints all play crucial roles.

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The term "user-friendly" became popular in the 1980s, 
                but Don Norman argued it's the wrong term. He said we should focus on making 
                systems "activity-centered" rather than just "friendly."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Local Impact:</strong> Pakistan's digital payment revolution (JazzCash, 
                Easypaisa) succeeds partly because of simple, intuitive UX design that works for 
                users with varying literacy levels.
